# PopcornFX Assets - O3DE Multiplayer Sample

The Multiplayer Sample includes nine visual FX assets created with PopcornFX. This README documents the these FX assets so that you can customize them or deconstruct them to learn how to build PopcornFX assets of your own.

The PopcornFX project containing all the source assets can be found in the following directory:
`<multiplayer-sample-root>/PopcornFX/PopcornProject.pkproj`.

## Requirements

The **PopcornFX** Gem depends on the following additional Gems:

* **Atom**
* **Script Canvas**
* **EMotionFX**
* **PhysX**
* **LyShine**
* **Starting Point Input**

## General information

Some of the FX are split into multiple parts (for example, Blast, Projectile, and Explosion). Splitting the FX makes it easier to integrate the FX into varied gameplay scenarios.

Many of the FX have a **Color Intensity** property that you can modify to adjust the emissive effect. The emissive effect requires that the **PostFX Layer** and **Bloom** components are added to the scene.

## Armor Power Up

The Armor Power Up is not a particle system, but rather mesh and shader asset.

The effect is triggered by the **Slider** property on the `ArmorPowerUp.material`.

The `Script_ArmorPowerUp.scriptcanvas` is a test Script Canvas that loops the Armor Power Up FX.

## Bubble Gun

## Energy Collector

The Energy Collector is a simple single emitter. It just needs to be placed accurately on an entity and triggered by Script Canvas.
